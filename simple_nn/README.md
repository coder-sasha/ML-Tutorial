**This folder serves as introduction to simple neural networks (NN).**  
The very good way to get familiar with NN is to build a simple model that is able to recognize some images.  
There is a popular and convenient set of data - **MNIST.** It this is a set of small images of Arabic digits.  
To save the space I keep input data in archives - get them from the data subfolder.  

Start either with the script or with notebooks to see how NN is composed, trained and checked.  
In the script we use indispensable **sklearn** to build a simple multi-layer perceptron.  
Notebooks are more versatile, there we also use the framework **TensorFlow** as a step to farther work with more complex NN.
