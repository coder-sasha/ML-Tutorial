# Advanced Data Processing with Pandas

This directory introduces you to learning advanced techniques of data selection with pandas. You will learn how to:

- **Select a subset of data**
- **Select multiple rows and columns from a dataset**
- **Sort a pandas DataFrame or a Series**
- **Filter rows of a pandas DataFrame**
- **Apply multiple filters to a pandas DataFrame**

We'll also look at:

- How to use the **axis** parameter in pandas
- The uses of **string methods** in pandas
- How to change the datatype of a pandas Series

## Datasets

We will use the following datasets:

- **data-titanic.csv**  
  The dataset of the Titanic's passenger survival data, available for download from Kaggle.
- **data-top-movies.csv**  
  Data sourced from Wikipedia.
- **data-zillow.csv**  
  Data from an American real estate marketplace (Zillow) that releases house price datasets as part of their research efforts.

> **Note:** These datasets are available in the public domain and are free to use.
