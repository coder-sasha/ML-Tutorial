**This folder serves for introduction of some NLP text classification methods.** 
We build a convolutional neural network - **CNN** and train it to classify texts, paticularly - the set of movie reviews.  
Create two data folders: text_pos and text_neg and unzip both archives into corresponding folders.  
The order of work:  
1) prepare-data.py   
2) train-cnn-model.py  
3) evaluate-cnn-model.py  

There is an alternative example: **sentiment-analysis.py.**  
This script shows how to classify texts with out of bos tools, like **NLTK** or **spaCy**  

**Have fun!**
