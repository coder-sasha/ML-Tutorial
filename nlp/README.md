**This folder serves for introduction of some NLP methods, important for ML.**  
Read the short guide **IntroductionToNLP.pdf** and get familiar with scripts.  
All data that scripts use are embedded, so just run them and understand what they do.  

When ready, enter the notebook folder and run sentiment-analysis notebook.  
It illustrates usage of neural network for sentiment analysis.  
NN is build with **TensorFlow**, so it is a more complicated exercise.  

You can add to the dataset your own sentences to check how good the network is, to see how it is done, check how the list **checks** goes through the code.  
Compare results and code with scripts from the text-classification folder.  
**Have fun!**
