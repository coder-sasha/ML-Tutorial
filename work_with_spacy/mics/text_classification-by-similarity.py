"""
The text similarity plays a key role in NLP
It is used for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and document clustering. 
Spacy provides powerful tools for measuring text similarity. 
This script demonstrates how Spacyâ€™s similarity functionality can be used to solve some NLP problems.
