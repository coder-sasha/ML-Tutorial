**Python** is a great programming/scripting language that can provide clarity, good speed and scalability fro your applications.  
It became the language choice for developers, engineers and scientists.  
This section of the tutorial offers a recipe approach, where each script is a recipe addressing specific programming task:  
- reading and writing into files;
- how to use generators and comprehension;
- how to use these two efficient coding techniques to create some fun output - in this case Pascal's triangle;
- how to create simple Python objects: queue and stack;  

Pay attention to run the script zen.py - very important!  
**Have Fun!**
